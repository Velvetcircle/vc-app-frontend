        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. 🌈 Nature of the Platform & Inclusivity Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Velvet Circle is a time-based, lifestyle companionship platform that connects verified adult users (“Clients”) with independent, consenting individuals (“Volunteers”) for social and emotional companionship.
        </p>
        <p>
          We firmly believe that every human being — regardless of gender, identity, or orientation — deserves connection and respect. We do not judge based on whether someone is male, female, transgender, non-binary, or LGBTQ+. We support all identities equally and are committed to maintaining a platform built on empathy, equality, and dignity.
        </p>
        <p className="text-red-300">
          ❌ We do not promote, facilitate, or engage in sexual services, escorting, or prostitution of any kind.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. ✅ Age and Identity Verification</h2>

        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">3. 🔐 Confidentiality & Hidden Identity Policy</h2>

          All users agree to maintain strict confidentiality regarding any personal details, conversations, or in-person meetings.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Disclosure of identity, location, or any session detail — online or offline — is prohibited.</li>
          <li>Screenshots, recordings, or sharing private information is strictly forbidden.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-red-300">
          📌 Violation = Lifetime ban + possible legal action under IT Act & IPC.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">4. 🚫 Prohibited Activities</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1 text-red-300">

        </ul>
        <p>
          ⚠️ Velvet Circle has zero tolerance for unethical behavior. If any sexual or illegal activity occurs, we will:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Terminate the account(s) immediately</li>
          <li>Report the incident to law enforcement</li>
          <li>Blacklist all involved parties permanently</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">5. ❌ Termination Policy</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">

          <li>Attempt to engage in or promote sexual activity</li>
          <li>Break the trust or privacy of others</li>

        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">6. ⚖️ Legal Compliance Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          Velvet Circle is fully compliant with Indian law, including the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, Information Technology Act, and all applicable state & privacy laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not facilitate hotel stays, bookings, or arrangements for meetings. We are not responsible for what two consenting adults do outside our app — as long as it does not violate our policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any attempt to maliciously misuse the platform or manipulate terms may result in criminal prosecution and a formal complaint to cybercrime authorities.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">7. 🎁 Gift Vouchers & Appreciation Policy</h2>
        <p>
          Volunteers are not employees and receive no payment for services. Appreciation may be offered through non-transactional gift vouchers — Amazon, Uber, Zomato, etc. These are not linked to behavior or physical activity, only to emotional time and consented companionship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clients understand that no physical services are guaranteed or implied.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">8. 🛡️ Platform Responsibility</h2>
        <p>
          Velvet Circle does not book or arrange meeting spaces/accommodations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not interfere with in-person meetings — clients and volunteers arrange them independently and at their own risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case of complaints or emergencies, we only provide platform-level mediation and user report documentation if required by law.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">9. ⚖️ Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of India. All legal matters fall under the jurisdiction of courts in [Insert Your City, e.g., Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh].
        </p>
