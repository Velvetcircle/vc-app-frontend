          At Velvet Circle, we believe that meaningful companionship deserves thoughtful recognition — not transactional payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Reward & Gifting Policy is designed to appreciate the time and emotional presence of our volunteers, while maintaining full legal and ethical boundaries.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">💠 1. Gifting – Not Compensation</h2>
        <p>
          Velvet Circle does not compensate volunteers based on time, activity, or personal conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any rewards, gifts, or vouchers offered are non-contractual, non-conditional, and given voluntarily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gifts are offered by Velvet Circle as part of an internal appreciation system — not as a result of any physical or sexual service.

          No reward is linked to any physical activity or private interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          All volunteers must accept the Volunteer Code of Conduct and agree to no expectations of payment or compensation.
