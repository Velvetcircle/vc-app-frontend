      <p>
        Because Every Life Matters.<br/>
        At Velvet Circle, we believe in something deeply human — that no one deserves to suffer in silence.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a world full of noise, likes, and replies... people are still feeling alone, unheard, and unseen.
        Some are battling breakups.<br/>
        Some are hiding behind fake smiles.<br/>
        Some are carrying trauma, pressure, or secrets that feel too heavy to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        We created Velvet Circle to say: <strong>“You matter. Your life matters. Your pain is real. And we’re here for you.”</strong>
      </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">💛 Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          To build a safe, non-judgmental space where anyone — of any age, gender, background, or pain — can be heard, understood, and emotionally supported.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not therapists.<br/>
          We are not bots.<br/>
          We are humans with hearts that care and ears that truly listen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you just need someone who gets it.
          Someone who won’t interrupt, lecture, or remember.
          Just someone who says,<br/>
          <strong>“Don’t worry. We got you.”</strong>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">🌱 Why We Exist</h2>
        <p>
          Because people are ending their lives over:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Failed relationships</li>
          <li>Exam results</li>
          <li>Job rejections</li>
          <li>Debt stress</li>
          <li>Loneliness</li>
          <li>Elderly abandonment</li>
          <li>Emotional abuse</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          And the worst part? They feel they can’t talk to anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are here to change that.
          Even if we can’t solve every problem, we’ll stand by you, talk with you, and help you breathe through it — one moment at a time.

        <p>
          We don’t judge.<br/>
          We don’t label.<br/>
          We don’t remember once your session ends.<br/>
          We just show up — with compassion, privacy, and a genuine desire to help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because healing begins when someone listens.
          And that’s what we do best.
